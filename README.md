# Reversing-Course-Final-CTF
Writeup for the final CTF of the reversing course

You can view the CTF written by Barak Gonen at תרגיל מסכם תשפד א

All credit on the CTF creation goes to professor Gonen.

The IDA file and the decryption code is available.

The loader and the decompilation of the decrypted dll were a bonus task, my solution isn't depended on them anyways.
